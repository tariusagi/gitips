1. Check remote URLs: `git remote -v`
2. Pull changes from remote and merge into local: `git pull`
3. Check for changes from remote:  run `git fetch` first, then `git diff main origin/main`.
4. Push changes to remote: `git push origin`
5. Revert all staged changes (with "git add"): `git reset`
6. Unstage changes to a single file: `git reset <file>`
